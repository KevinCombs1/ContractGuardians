      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>What makes a contract legally void?</summary>
        <p>
          A contract can be legally void if it involves illegal activity, lacks essential elements (offer, acceptance, consideration), was signed under duress, misrepresentation, fraud, undue influence, or if the subject matter is unlawful.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I exit a contract if I just change my mind?</summary>
        <p>
          Generally, a simple change of mind is not enough. You must have legal grounds such as fraud, misrepresentation, illegality, or breach of contract to terminate it without penalty.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do you provide representation or only advice?</summary>
        <p>
          Contract Guardians partners with licensed attorneys who provide full legal representation when necessary. We provide guidance and education, and connect clients to the right legal resources for enforcement or rescission.
