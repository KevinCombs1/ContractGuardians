    <div class="card fade-init">
      <h3>Types of Contracts</h3>
      <p>Contracts may be written, oral, express, or implied. Understanding which type applies to your agreements is essential for evaluating enforceability. In Real Estate, common contracts include purchase agreements, leases, and service agreements. In Technology, software licensing, SaaS agreements, and developer contracts are critical.</p>

    <div class="card fade-init">
      <h3>Types of Law</h3>
