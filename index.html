      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>What makes a contract legally void or unenforceable?</summary>
        <p>
          Contracts may be void if they involve illegal subject matter or violate public policy. A contract is voidable if signed under fraud, misrepresentation, duress, undue influence, or mistake. Courts will consider enforceability based on statutory and common law principles.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I exit a contract just because I changed my mind?</summary>
        <p>
          No. Exiting a contract without legal grounds usually triggers penalties. Valid grounds include fraud, misrepresentation, unconscionable terms, or statutory consumer protections.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do you provide legal representation or only advice?</summary>
        <p>
          Contract Guardians partners with licensed attorneys to provide full legal representation when necessary. We educate clients and ensure compliance, then handle negotiations or court filings if required.
